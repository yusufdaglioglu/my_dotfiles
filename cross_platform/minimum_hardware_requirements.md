## Android Emulator
https://developer.android.com/studio/run/emulator#requirements
- 16 GB RAM
- 64-bit OS
- For extra speed with acceleration
  
  https://developer.android.com/studio/run/emulator-acceleration

  - Intel Processors with Intel Virtualization Technology (VT-x)
  - AMD Processors with AMD-V (SVM)
  - Apple silicon M1 and M2 families

- Second-level address translation (SLAT). Named on each brand:
  - for Intel --> EPT
  - for AMD --> RVI

## General notes for Android Emulator acceleration (this is not requirement)
if accelerated emulator running, you can not:
  - run another app which requires virtualization technology.
  - run accelerated emulator inside a VM.

## Windows 11

  - For Intel --> XD bit (execute disable bit).
  - For AMD --> NX bit (no execute bit).

- Only for SR-IOV feature: 

  - Extended Page Table (EPT) or AMD's Nested Page Table (NPT)

  - The chipset must have:

    - Interrupt remapping - Intel's VT-d with the Interrupt Remapping capability (VT-d2) or any version of AMD I/O Memory Management Unit (I/O MMU).
