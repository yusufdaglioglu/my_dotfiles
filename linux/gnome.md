# GNOME EXTENSIONS

## How to add border around windows

- ### a- via Extension

I dont prefer this extension. because:
- it is maitaing only by a few developer (it has a blocker bug, it did not get fixed long time).
- I only use 1 feature of that extension. but it has a lot of features. which can make additional bugs on desktop.

name: "rounded-window-corners". (It forked by nother developer with name: "Rounded Window Corners Reborn")

Settings for extension:
- Skip LibAdwaita Application --> false
- border width --> 3
- border color --> pink or orange or red

- ### b- via acccesibility

Gnome settings --> Accesibility --> seeing --> Enable "Hight contrast"

"Hight contrast" feature is not good as extension. but "Hight contrast" also enables broders inside window elements (buttons etc...). I always enable this, even extension is active.

## How to see window list under desktop (panel)
extension name: window-list

## Alt tab
There is no need to install any extension to change the behavior.

As default Gnome enables "application switcher" feature when you click ALT+TAB. But I prefer "window-switcher" which can be enabled via:

Gnome settings --> Keyboard --> View and Customize Shortcuts --> Navigation -->

- "Switch applications" --> disabled
- "Switch windows" --> ALT+TAB
